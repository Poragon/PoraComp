Wondering something about PoraComp that wasn't answered with the changelog? Wonder no more, finding the answer here should be (hopefully) easy!

# What is PoraComp?

PoraComp is, as the name and description suggests, a complimation of all mods I've created! It serves as a very convient way for me to push updates to all
mods at once, and as a modular way to get all my mods.
The modular aspect is important, as PoraComp is comprised of very different sections, which may or may not be wanted by any said person. If you find yourself
not liking a particular section, you can delete the corresponding folder within the mod directory and be done with it!

# What's in PoraComp?

In its current state PoraComp is composed of multiple modules;

No Freeze - Removes all freezing from food items and water

BioCo - Adds in various items and mechanics focused around a prewar, hightech corporation

MutEx - Aims to create a challange of the midgame and balance the new additions of BioCo with strong, unusual foes that will require more than holding tab

Lipids - Adds a fat system that is based upon your metabolic rate!

PoraComp - Misc. changes and balance that are more my personnal take on vanilla content.

# No Freeze FAQ

Q: "x" is freezing, and I don't think it should be!

A: Go ahead and either throw up an issue on this repository detailing the item in question and our situation, or just go ahead and ping me on the discord


Q: I can't freeze fod anymore with my minifreezer?

A: Due to the lower of freezing temperatures, freezing items is no longer possible even when intended. Cooling items will still slow rot though!

# BioCo FAQ

Q: What's this TK Izu thing?

A: It's a big space station in orbit, used by BioCo to express 'ship' items and at times creatures. You can use this station to drop-pod down items as well.
You just have to find some way to communicate with the station and some security clearances first!

Q: I found TK Izu stuff, but it's asking for a lot of money!

A: Space is a notoriously expensive medium to move objects through. 
Even smaller items are going to draw a small fortune from you to ship down. Ya got something to do with all those cash cards now though!

# MutEx FAQ

Q: These new zombies hurt.

A: They very much are intended too! Some of them can be blatantly unfair at points, and are also intended to be so!
Bring explosives, fire, traps, and other methods to battle and try to keep away from engaging in melee range of more lethal foes.

Q: The beserker won't take any damage!

A: The beserker has a cut armor value of *150* at full health. Bash is lower, but also pretty high. As the beserkers' health goes down its armor will too, so chip away at it with a non bash/cut/pierce damage first (eg. fire) to get it within killing range. Also be when its roars.

Q: Zombie's suddenly are moving faster/I'm moving slower/Everything is screwed

A: Check for an Echo zed. These guys got *nasty* CC abilities including rolling a random speed malus/bonus on every single monster near you.
Take them out as fast as possible if they're in a group.

Q: How does this raid system work?

A: Short awnser is; after the days passed since mod installation passes 31 (unless changed in the settings.lua file) the game will roll for a raid chance each night.
If the roll is sucessful a raid will occur at some point during the next 2-4 days. The strength and time at which the raid occurs are determined by how old your character is.
The raids draw from the zombie, robot, nether, or triffid factions. They can be very terrifying late game, especially if you hit a high point robot raid. Secubots scary.

Q: Can I disable raids?

A: Yep, take a gander over at settings.lua for not only a way to disable raids entirely but many other options as well.

# Lipids FAQ

Q: Can I disable lipids?

A: Yes! And change tons about the system, just go take a look at the settings.lua file in the mod directory.
