Wondering something about PoraComp that wasn't answered with the changelog? Wonder no more, finding the answer here should be (hopefully) easy!

# What is PoraComp?

PoraComp is, as the name and description suggests, a complimation of all mods I've created! It serves as a very convient way for me to push updates to all
mods at once, and as a modular way to get all my mods.
The modular aspect is important, as PoraComp is comprised of very different sections, which may or may not be wanted by any said person. If you find yourself
not liking a particular section, you can delete the corresponding folder within the mod directory and be done with it!

# What's in PoraComp?

In its current state PoraComp is composed of three modules;

No Freeze - Removes all freezing from food items and water

BioCo - Adds in various items and mechanics focused around a prewar, hightech corporation

MutEx - Aims to create a challange of the midgame and balance the new additions of BioCo with strong, unusual foes that will require more than holding tab

# No Freeze FAQ

Q: "x" is freezing, and I don't think it should be!

A: Go ahead and either throw up an issue on this repository detailing the item in question and our situation, or just go ahead and ping me on the discord


Q: I can't freeze fod anymore with my minifreezer?

A: Due to the lower of freezing temperatures, freezing items is no longer possible even when intended. Cooling items will still slow rot though!

# BioCo FAQ

Not really sure what would go here. Hit me up here or on discord if you got a question!

# MutEx FAQ

Q: These new zombies hurt.

A: They very much are intended too! Some of them can be blatantly unfair at points, and are also intended to be so!

Q: The beserker won't take any damage!

A: The beserker has a cut armor value of *150* at full health. Bash is lower, but also pretty high. As the beserkers' health goes down its armor will too,
so chip away at it with a non bash/cut/pierce damage first (eg. fire) to get it within killing range. Also be careful of its screams.

Q: Zombie's suddenly are moving faster/I'm moving slower/Everything is screwed

A: Check for an Echo zed. These guys got *nasty* CC abilities including rolling a random speed malus/bonus on every single monster near you.
Take them out as fast as possible if they're in a group.
